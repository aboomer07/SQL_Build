# SQL Database Design and Construction

This project was done for the final project of the Databases class during my masters program at the Toulouse School of Economics. It was done in collaboration with Jacob Pichelmann.

## Overview
The prompt of this project was to build a sample database to track the environmentally friendly actions of companies. To this end, we designed and set up the database architecture with Entity-Relationship models and Relational models. To provide a user friendly front end, a Tkinter app was set up to interact with the project and scroll through the resulting tables, graphs, and analyses.

## Data Sources
Sample data for the database was hand coded into google sheets. The google sheets python interface was used to pull it into python to automatically generate and populate the SQL tables.

## Tools
The paper was built using Latex. SQLite was used as the SQL database software. The GUI application interface, automated population of tables, and graphical analysis was done in Python using the sqlite3, gspread, tkinter, PIL, geopandas, and Seaborn packages.
